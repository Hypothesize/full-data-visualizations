People are practically gambling over how important tech is in industries, how soon human labour will be replaced by robots, how AI is transforming the world, then what? Don't get me wrong, but I feel like the general outlook guys have on technology is that it's basically futuristic, and that it hasn't fully bloomed yet. We see Tesla and think it will be fully feasible when our kids have their kids or a time such as that. Or we hear AI and push it to the back of our minds as something Bill Gates has a team to handle. But now when tech seems to be the fibre that holds businesses and communities together, suddenly everyone is on the rush to ensure they are ‘tech-compliant’. We really need to deeply and seriously think about realistic ways to make tech work for us. It's no longer something only the experts should deal with.

I remember a few years ago, I didn't really understand what coding was, and why it was really as important as it is portrayed. Then recently, I did have a realization that not everyone has to learn coding, but everyone has a part to play to ensure coders code. It's like buying something from the store. The fact that I need it means that the store ensures it is there. If people need milk, the store loads it up. Demand and supply. When we stop coming to buy milk, they really don't need to have it at all. Action and reaction8 sort of thing. It's two-way. There's the client and the developer. I realized that I don't have to do the actual coding, I could think up ideas. And it's not as hard as it looks like.

What tech idea would be helpful during this Covid-19 period? Automatic testers? Store tactics to ensure no hoarding? Food delivery systems? Automated yet personal motivational messaging apps?

Let's get to the analytics. Right now we’d all want simulations or data analytics to tell us how long this will last. Try calculating it by yourself, see the curve for yourself. Think of ways this curve could be flattened, with the data within your reach.

Basically, I'm tired of people having a lazed outlook on technology. This wasn't meant to be as hard as scholars have put it. You don't have to be on the top tiers of IQ, just look at what is around you and seek solutions. Tech is just solutions to day-to-day problems.

Help out in filling surveys, data sets, comments to encourage others. All these use tech, right? Let's not just wait for the coders to do all the nitty-gritty. Maybe out of all the great wisdom humans have, something wonderful will come out. The most important and far-reaching solutions come from the simplest of circumstances.

So basically we need to change our perception of technology.

Anyways, all we have is problems. Yes, I lover her dearly but that does not mean I am happy.

Communication is one of the biggest problem we have. I try to say something with the best intention possible but it just backfires.

She drives my car. She says her car needs fixed. She is short of cash so I said you give what you have and I will help you with the rest to fix it.

No, you fix it for me and I will use my money for buying stuff. She loves stuff.

I have noticed every time she has something to say, it is about what she wants or it is negative news.

I want a new car, or I want to travel. She barely makes anything. I make a little more but I have a lot of debt which I am unable to get to as I am trying to keep up with her.

Anything she asks and you say no to, she throws a fit. It is a fight.

She will wake up if her kids need her but God forbid I have to go somewhere. It becomes a drag. She makes me feel as a favor.

She uses me everyday. I am with her because I know she needs me. I am afraid to leave her thinking she will fall apart. I am miserable.
